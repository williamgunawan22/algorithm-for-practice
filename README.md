# Algorithm For Practice
This repository created for help folks practice algorithm, important code have helpful comment to figure out what the algorithm doing. 

It's easier to learn the algorithm in your favourite language that the reason i made this repository. I found out it's pretty hard to find resource with multiple programming language for us to choose.

This repository can also help you to figure out the difference between language, how things work for each language.

For the next language is programming language Python and Java.

For the next algorithm is Radix Sort (String and Int) and Suffix Tree.
